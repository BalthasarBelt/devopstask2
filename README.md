# devopstask2
1 - Create a Dockerfile that builds nginx image./
  2 - Image must be very light, try to use only needed OS and packages./
  3 - After the image is build it needs to change port in configuration file within the container itself to 9000./
  4 - Make sure that the port used on a host is also 9000./
  5 - Lastly, give the image a proper tag, make sure it updates nginx to a last stable version and prepare a very basic html page that will be copied to image as a starting page. It can be only a basic text, nothing much./
